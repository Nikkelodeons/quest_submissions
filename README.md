## Chapter 1 - Day 1

Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
- A blockchain is a distributed database that stores data on nodes of a computer network

Explain what a Smart Contract is. 
- A smart contract is an application that determines the rules in which users can interact with the blockchain

Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
- A script allows users to view data and is free.  A transaction makes changes to data on the blockchain and costs money. 

## Chapter 1 - Day 2

What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
- Safety & Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
- The 5 pillars could be useful to:
  - make it easier for more developers to learn Cadence thus attracting more developers to flow
    - the more developers on flow, the more applications exist for users to interact on flow which could increase user participation on the flow blockchain
  - make it easy to ensure the security of smart contracts so users' valuables are not compromised on the blockchain
  - make the flow blockchain more mainstream


## Chapter 2 - Day 1

1. Deploy a contract to account 0x03 called "JacobTucker". Inside that contract, declare a constant variable named is, and make it have type String. Initialize it to "the best" when your contract gets deployed.

2. Check that your variable is actually equals "the best" by executing a script to read that variable. Include a screenshot of the output.
